## Log

### R1D4
FINALLY worked out why the api import was failing. It seems I didn't understand how to use mashape where the quote api was coming from and didn't have the correct information and credentials. So happy it is now working and I have random movie quotes! You can see the codepen here, still some work to do on it: https://codepen.io/nickihastings/full/BYappV/
I'm also trying to add as much code to github as possible to learn how it all works, so I have created a GIST with my javascript code. I don't know if this the correct way of doing, but it seemed like a good idea. https://gist.github.com/nickihastings/edbedf8166fa6862a98007031215fbc8

### R1D3
Had a frustrating hour of coding trying to get my ajax code to import an api and display quotes for the random code machine. Not working. Still not sure if there's something I'm doing wrong in codepen, or my code is wrong. 

### R1D2
Not much actual coding today, only an hour spent reading up on AJAX and JSON, any tutorials I could find. Every example is different, so for a newbie it's confusing. Hoping to get back on the code tomorrow.

### R1D1 
Started work on the Random Quote Machine from Free Code Camp, struggling a bit with JSON and AJAX, need to start again from scratch with some straight forward tutorials. Base html and css all set up now https://codepen.io/nickihastings/full/BYappV/. Decided to use the github 100-days-of-code log to track my progress and realising now how little I know about how to use github, fork, commit...!! I guess this will be a steep learning curve.
