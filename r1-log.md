### R1D1 
Started work on the Random Quote Machine from Free Code Camp, struggling a bit with JSON and AJAX, need to start again from scratch with some straight forward tutorials. Base html and css all set up now https://codepen.io/nickihastings/full/BYappV/. Decided to use the github 100-days-of-code log to track my progress and realising now how little I know about how to use github, fork, commit...!! I guess this will be a steep learning curve.
